#  Beginner(ish) Verilog Design Project Ideas 

For any of these projects:

Try and explore the concepts in the Verilog roadmap through these projects to buiild your skills over time.

The code you write at first will probably not be great, but with a little bit of time and feedback you will see progress.


a. Design the logic conceptually first (On paper even? :0), optionally even write a specification


b. Then write veriliog module(s) for your design.


c. Create a test plan to make sure your module works


d. Write testbenches for your design.


e. Put it in a github repo and show it off later :P



These projects are just ideas, feel free to be creative and aim high, if there is a particluar area you are interested in - e.g. DSP, Audio Synthesis, Retro Gaming, Graphics, CPU design, GPU Design, or anyhting else - look into how the systems you are work. Read docs, watch youtube videos and  maybe try and making some modules based on the pre-existing hardware and the large open-source community that is already out there.


**Ideas:**

1. **Majority Voter Circuit**  
    Output is high if the majority of inputs are high (e.g., 3-input majority).

2. **Comparator**  
    Compare two 4-bit numbers and output greater than, less than, or equal signals.

3. **Parity Generator/Checker**  
    Generate or check even/odd parity for a given set of input bits.

4. **Multiplexer/Demultiplexer**  
    Implement 4-to-1 multiplexer and 1-to-4 demultiplexer.

5. **Binary Adder/Subtractor**  
    Design a 4-bit ripple-carry adder and/or subtractor.

6. **Priority Selector**  
    Output the highest-priority active input among several lines.

7. **Code Converter**  
    Convert between binary, BCD, and excess-3 codes.

8. **Barrel Shifter**  
    Shift a 4-bit input left or right by a variable amount.

9. **Odd/Even Detector**  
    Output whether a 4-bit input is odd or even.

10. **Magnitude Comparator**  
     Output which of two 4-bit numbers is larger, or if they are equal.

1. **4-bit Binary Counter**  
    Design a synchronous up/down counter with reset.

1. **4-bit Binary Counter**  
    Design a synchronous up/down counter with reset.

4. **Digital Dice**  
    Synchronous Random number generator (1-6), Binary output.

5. **Simple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**  
    Perform basic operations: add, subtract, AND, OR.

6. **Sequence Detector**  
    Detect a specific bit pattern in a serial input stream.

7. **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Generator**  
    Generate PWM signals with adjustable duty cycle.

8. **Binary to Gray Code Converter**  
    Convert 4-bit binary numbers to Gray code.

10. **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)**
    Implement a UART half duplex module for serial communication, including baud rate generation, transmit, and receive logic.

11. **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Master/Slave**
    Design SPI main and/or subnode modules to communicate with external devices.

17. **Custom Protocol Implementation**
    Define and implement a simple custom communication protocol, including framing, error detection, and handshaking.
